# MyTeams
## About
This is a real-time application built using Flutter & Firebase allowing people in different parts of the world to connect with ease and enjoy chatting as well as video calling with some additional functionalities.

## Agile Showcase
In this project, Agile was used by me. I broke the project into short-duration ‘sprints’. Each sprint was of the same duration lasting a week offering me the freedom of testing my application by building it and trying to run it on my device so that I can get the user experience. Also, regular team meetings were held with mentors at the end of each sprint for checking the possible roadblocks. 
Besides the meetings, here is the schedule for the sprint planning and tracking:
In week 1, I planned and designed the solution, decided the functionalities I thought to incorporate in the app and designed the wireframes accordingly. 
In week 2, I included the video conference meeting with some extra features such as raise hand, screen sharing, chat, add meeting password etc. 
In week 3 I created the authentication service by which users can register and sign in to the app and also added the profile section which can be modified by the user
In week 4, I worked on the adapt phase in which I built the chat feature outside the meeting where the chat will not be lost even after the meeting ends.
